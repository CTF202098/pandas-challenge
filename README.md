1.	For this activity, no starter code was deleted or unused. All of my own original code as well as code I used from Professor Booth’s examples is built on the provided starter code. 
2.	I used code provided in the example by Professor Booth through cell 8.
3.	For cell 9, I followed the pattern from 8, and for cell 10 I used the starter code that was available. 
4.	Cells 11 and 12 were also copied from Prof’s example. 
5.	I followed the example from cell 12 through cell 15. I used Prof.’s example for per_school_capita.
6.	Cell 16 was copied from Prof.’s example.
7.	For cells 17 through 19 I used the provided starter code.
8.	Cell 23 was copied from Prof. Booth’s example. I originally coded it out manually, but there was an error that I was not able to understand enough to resolve. Upon looking at Prof.’s example, the only difference in what I had coded manually and what he had provided was capitalization inside of quotation marks. I used his code because it worked and mine didn’t.
9.	Cell 24 was also copied from Prof. example. For cell 25, I used the same code but inverted the ascending order.
10.	I used Prof.’s example in cell 26 to group by school name. I coded my own data frame, but realized afterward that I had used the same method as Prof.
11.	For cell 27, I followed the pattern from cell 26. I had to amend the column names of the data frame so that they did not include “Reading Scores” in the title in order for the starter code index to work. I wanted there to be a label so that I could quickly tell what this chart shows when I did my analysis, so I searched Stack Overflow for a method to title data frames in Pandas. I used the code line df = df.style.set_caption('Top 10 Fields of Research by Aggregated Funding Amount') which I found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57958432/how-to-add-table-title-in-python-preferably-with-pandas . I modified this code to fit the data frame I was using. I liked having a title, so I went back up to cell 26 and added one there as well. 
12.	For cell 30, I used the code in Prof’s example. 
13.	Cells 32, 35, 37, and 39 were coded without outside resources but while reusing code from previous cells. The cells between those were pre-filled by starter code.
